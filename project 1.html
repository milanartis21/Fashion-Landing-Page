      <h2>Fashion over the Centuries</h2>
      <p>
        The history of fashion design begins in Ancient Rome and Ancient Egypt.
        In these cultures, clothing and fashion were status symbols. Those who
        were wealthy would wear expensive and stylish garments that were
        colorful, while the poor would wear neutral colors and their garments
        were cheap but useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a versatile art form, fashion illustration is intended to showcase
        the material, colors, and design of clothing. In addition to acting as a
        study of style, these drawings also inadvertently offer a glimpse into
        the history of fashion design and social pop culture of the time, as
        evident in this collection of delicate and detailed illustrations.<br />
        <br />

        Meticulously compiled using a number of historic fashion plates, this
        timeline showcases the many shifts in styles that occurred in women's
        fashion over the course of nearly 200 years. The chronological
        presentation begins in the year 1784, when frilly, floor-length hoop
        skirts were all the rage. It then meanders through the next several
        decades, depicting a gradual tendency toward slimmer silhouettes in the
        early 1800s, a preference for over-the-top headdresses in the 1830s, and
        the re-emergence of the fuller ballgown in the 1860s.
